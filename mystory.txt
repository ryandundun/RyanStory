Ryan wanted to get some fresh air so he went on a walk. While walking he saw a snake and began to run fast. When he realized the snake was actually a stick, he laughed.

Ryan then tripped over another stick. He looked down and found out that stick WAS actually a snake! He began to run fast again and tripped over a pebble on the ground.
Worried that the snake may catch him on the run, he got up and flew away.

Ryan began to soar high above the trees, worried he may be attacked by another snake. However, Ryan couldn't fly forever. He returned to his nest, but suddenly he discovered something unexpected.

The snaked followed him, however. They slithered through the air in pursuit of Ryan.

Then both got hit by lighting. the end
